Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
There were so many vulnerabilities related to the stack, to name a fews:
- EC2 has public IP adrressed. The instance should be placed in private subnet, without public IP.
- ELB has no deletion prevent, and no logging enabled. Simply enables them to remediate.
- IAM policy does not follow least priviledge access. IAM Policy should separate access to specific bucket with minimized write access.
- EC2 attached EBS has no encryption. Simply enables them to remediate.
- SG allows SSH to EC2. Check ingress rule of SG, remove the allow for SSH.
